For Data Access samples, go to the excellent [ORM Cookbook](https://github.com/Grauenwolf/DotNet-ORM-Cookbook). .NET team also has [a sample repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples).

## How to run these samples

To run these samples, simply open your command line console, go to each folder and execute `dotnet watch run`.

### Misc (6)

-   [Application Environment](/projects/application-environment)

    This sample shows how to obtain application environment information (target framework, etc).

-   [Show Connection info](/projects/connection-info)

    Enumerate the connection information of a HTTP request.

-   [Keeping track of anonymous users](/projects/anonymous-id)

    Keep track of anonymous user in your ASP.NET Core (useful in scenario such as keeping track of shopping cart) using `ReturnTrue.AspNetCore.Identity.Anonymous` library.

-   [Password Hasher server](/projects/password-hasher)

    Give it a string and it will generate a secure hash for you, e.g. `localhost:5000?password=mypassword`.

-   [Version info](/projects/version)

    Show various version info of the framework your system is running on.

-   [IApplicationLifetime](/projects/i-application-lifetime)

    Responds to application startup and shutdown.

    We are using `IApplicationLifetime` that trigger events during application startup and shutdown.

### Server-Sent Events (1)

-   [Forever Server](/projects/sse)

    This server will send a 'hello world' greeting forever.

### Markdown (2)

-   [Markdown server](/projects/markdown-server)

    Serve markdown file as html file. You will see how you can create useful app using a few basic facilities in aspnetcore.

    We take `"Markdig"` as dependency.

-   [Markdown server - implemented as middleware component](/projects/markdown-server-middleware)

    Serve markdown file as html file. It has the same exact functionality as [Markdown server](/projects/markdown-server) but implemented using middleware component.

    We take `"Markdig"` as dependency.

### Utils (3)

-   [Status Codes](/projects/utils/http-status-codes)

    Here we contrast between the usage of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes` and `System.Net.HttpStatusCode`.

-   [MediaTypeNames](/projects/utils/media-type-names)

    This class provides convenient constants for some common MIME types. It's not extensive by any means however `MediaTypeNames.Text.Html` and `MediaTypeNames.Application.Json` come handy.

-   [MediaTypeNames - 2](/projects/utils/media-type-names-2)

    Using `FileExtensionContentTypeProvider` to obtain the correct MIME type of a filename extension.

### Device Detection (1)

The samples in this section rely on [Wangkanai.Detection](https://github.com/wangkanai/Detection) library.

-   [Device Detection](/projects/device-detection)

    This is the most basic device detection. You will be able to detect whether the client is a desktop or a mobile client.

### Image Sharp (1)

All these samples require `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web` middleware package. This middleware is an excelent tool to process your day to day image processing need.

-   [Image-Sharp](/projects/image-sharp)

    This example shows how to enable image resizing functionality to your site. It's super easy and the middleware takes care of caching, etc.
