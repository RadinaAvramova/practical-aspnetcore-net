# WebApplicationBuilder - Set environment by code

In most cases using ```WebApplication``` isn't enough because you need to configure additional services to be used in your system. This is where ```WebApplicationBuilder``` comes. It allows you to configure services and other properties.

In this example we show how to set the environment of the application by using `WebApplicationOptions`.

You can read the implementation of ```WebApplication``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplication.cs) and its sibling ```WebApplicationBuilder``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplicationBuilder.cs)
