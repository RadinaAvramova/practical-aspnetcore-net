# WebApplication - application lifetime events

This sample uses the brand new `WebApplication` hosting class. In this example we learn how to respond to the application lifetime events available.

You can read the implementation of ```WebApplication``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplication.cs) and its sibling ```WebApplicationBuilder``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplicationBuilder.cs)
