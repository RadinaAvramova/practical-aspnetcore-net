# WebApplication - Listen to a specific url and port

This sample uses the brand new `WebApplication` hosting class. In this example we set the Kestrel web server to listen to a specific url and port. You can open the page at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can read the implementation of ```WebApplication``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplication.cs) and its sibling ```WebApplicationBuilder``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplicationBuilder.cs)
