# WebApplication - middleware pipeline 2

This sample uses the brand new `WebApplication` hosting class. 

In this example we use `EndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.Map` and `IEndPointRouteBuilder.CreateApplicationBuilder` to build two separate middleware pipelines than handle "/" and "/about-us" routes.
