# WebApplication - Default Logging

This sample uses the brand new `WebApplication` hosting class. 

`WebApplication.Logger` is available for use immediately without any further configuration. However the default logger is not available via DI.

You can read the implementation of ```WebApplication``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplication.cs) and its sibling ```WebApplicationBuilder``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplicationBuilder.cs)
