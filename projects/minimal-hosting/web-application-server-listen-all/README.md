# WebApplication - Listen to all interfaces (IP4 and IP6) on specific port.

This sample uses the brand new `WebApplication` hosting class. In this example we set the Kestrel web server to listen to all interfaces on a specific port. You can open the page at `http://localhost:3000` or any host/ip on your machine at port 3000.
