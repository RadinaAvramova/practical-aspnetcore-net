# WebApplication - Default Urls

This sample uses the brand new `WebApplication` hosting class. 

In this example we shows the urls that Kestrel web server by default is listening to (`WebApplication.Urls`).

You can read the implementation of ```WebApplication``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplication.cs) and its sibling ```WebApplicationBuilder``` [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/DefaultBuilder/src/WebApplicationBuilder.cs)
