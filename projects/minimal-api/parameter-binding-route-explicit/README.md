# Explicit route parameter binding

This example shows usage of explicit route parameter binding of `int` and `string` types using `[FromRoute]` attribute.

Note: This example isn't working yet in RC2. There is a confirmed bug with FromRouteAttribute Name property that that has already been fixed but not available in RC2 (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/37268)
