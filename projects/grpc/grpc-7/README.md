# Sending map values (dictionary)

This sample shows how to define Protocol Buffers format to support sending map values (dictionary).

The key must not repeat and can be string or scalar types except floating points and bytes. The value can be anything except another map. More details can be found at this [Protocol Buffers documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#maps).
