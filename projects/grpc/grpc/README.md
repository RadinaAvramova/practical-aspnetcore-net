# gRPC Hello World

If you are not familiar with gRPC, it's useful to spend some time reading up about it [here](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/). It is also useful to read about [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), the data format that it's implemented in.

This sample demonstrate a simple Unary RPC. The client side is located on `client` folder and the server at the `server` folder. Make sure you run the server **first** before running the client.

The copies of `billboard.proto` on both folders are identical.
