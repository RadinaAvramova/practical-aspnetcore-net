# Sequence activity

We use the `Sequence` activity to create a sequence of activities. The `Sequence` activity is a container activity that contains other activities. The `Sequence` activity executes the activities in the order they are added to the workflow.

We also use `Variable` class. The `Variable` class is used to create a variable that can be used in the workflow. The `Variable` class has a `Name` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `Variable` class also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.
