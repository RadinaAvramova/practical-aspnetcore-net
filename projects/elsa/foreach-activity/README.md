# ForEach activity

We use `ForEach` activity to execute a workflow in loop based on a given collection. The `ForEach` activity has a `Body` property that is used to specify the workflow to be executed in loop. The `ForEach` activity also has a `Values` property that is used to specify the enumerable collection.

We also use `Variable` class. The `Variable` class is used to create a variable that can be used in the workflow. The `Variable` class has a `Name` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `Variable` class also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.
