# For activity

We use `For` activity to execute a workflow in loop within specified parameters. The `For` activity has a `Start` property that is used to specify the start value. The `For` activity also has a `End` property that is used to specify the end value. The `For` activity also has a `Step` property that is used to specify the step value. The `For` activity also has a `Body` property that is used to specify the body of the `For` activity.

We also use `Variable` class. The `Variable` class is used to create a variable that can be used in the workflow. The `Variable` class has a `Name` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `Variable` class also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.
