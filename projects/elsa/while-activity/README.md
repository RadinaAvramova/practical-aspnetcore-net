# While activity

We use `While` activity to execute a workflow while a condition is true. The `While` activity has a `Condition` property that is used to specify the condition. The `While` activity also has a `Body` property that is used to specify the body of the `While` activity. The `Body` property will continue to be executed while the `Condition` is true.

We also use `Variable` class. The `Variable` class is used to create a variable that can be used in the workflow. The `Variable` class has a `Name` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `Variable` class also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.
