# SetVariable activity

We use `SetVariable` to set value to a variable in a workflow. The `SetVariable` activity has a `VariableName` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `SetVariable` activity also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.

We also use `Variable` class. The `Variable` class is used to create a variable that can be used in the workflow. The `Variable` class has a `Name` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `Variable` class also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.
