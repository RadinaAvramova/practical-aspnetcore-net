# If activity

We use the `If` activity to execute a set of activities based on a condition. The `If` activity has a `Condition` property that is used to specify the condition. The `Condition` property is of type `Expression` and is used to specify the condition. The `If` activity also has an `Then` property that is used to specify the activities that will be executed if the condition is true. The `If` activity also has an `Else` property that is used to specify the activities that will be executed if the condition is false.

We also use `Variable` class. The `Variable` class is used to create a variable that can be used in the workflow. The `Variable` class has a `Name` property that is used to specify the name of the variable. The `Variable` class also has a `Value` property that is used to specify the value of the variable.
